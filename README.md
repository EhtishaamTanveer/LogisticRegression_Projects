# Logistic Regression Projects

This Github Repo contains 2 Logistic Regression projects; one focuses on non-regularized case and the other on regularized case

**Logistic Regression** is part of Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm which focuses on Binary Classification, meaning the output is in the form of Yes or No. 

Ultimate aim of both projects is to build a Logistic Regression model from scratch and predict the outcome with high accuracy, along with coming with a best fit polynomial that separates the different datapoints.

I have completed these projects all by myself while completing my Coursera specialization "Machine Learning Specialization" https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/specialization/NG3GPTVN7M8E?utm_source=link&utm_medium=certificate&utm_content=cert_image&utm_campaign=sharing_cta&utm_product=s12n
